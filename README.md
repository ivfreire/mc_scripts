# Minecraft Exploitation Tools

Minecraft is already a really fun game, but understanding how the game works and trying to hack it is an even more fun. Recently I have tried to develop this set of tools for Minecraft exploitation, so far I have only created scripts for packet hacking using socket implementation in Python. However, as I learn more about the game mechanics, I intend to develop several other tools.
Feel free to use, modify or redistribute theses scripts, and if you want to you are welcome to contribute to this project (I would be glad if you did). I also would like to remind you that I am no pro on game hacking, thus please take this with a grain of salt.
Last but not least, I would like to make an appeal to you: use these tools with responsability, game hacking is fun and educative but nobody likes a hacker on a real game session. In a few words... do not be a jerk, please.

OBS: Later I also plan to extend this README file :)
